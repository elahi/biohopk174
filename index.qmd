This website is a space for working through Quinn and Keough's 2nd edition [textbook](https://qkstats.com/) on data analysis for biologists. The `Chapter notes` are intended for review and discussion in a seminar ([Oceans 200](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=Oceans+200&collapse=)). The `Slides` are intended as a short primer on the topic by the discussion leader. The `Examples` are reproduced and lightly modified from the [original worked examples](https://mjkeough.github.io/index.html).
